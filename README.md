 * Now look for the ap folder with ther version number you want to build (For example, **_app v2_** if you want to build version 2).
 * Rename it to **_app_** and delete all the other folders beginning with app (For example, **_app v1_**)
 * In the end open your Android Studio and go to **Files > Open Project**.

Alternatively, you can use the **Check out project from Version Control** option in Android Studio to download the project.
